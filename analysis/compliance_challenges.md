# Compliance and Documentation Challenges

Regulated environments rely on complete, consistent, and traceable records. Documentation gaps create risk because audits and inspections evaluate both the content and the control process around records.

## Frequent breakdowns
- missing lot numbers, dates, or signatures
- outdated revisions (wrong specification or procedure)
- scan quality issues that reduce searchability
- manual review bottlenecks that slow releases
- inconsistent file naming and storage locations

## Business impact
Documentation issues can cause:
- batch release delays
- rework and re-testing
- audit findings and corrective actions
- supplier re-qualification effort

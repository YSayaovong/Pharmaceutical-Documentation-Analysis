# Vendor Document Structure: What QA Reviews

Vendor documentation is predictable across three high-volume types.

## Certificate of Analysis (CoA)
Typical required fields:
- supplier, material name, lot/batch ID
- manufacture and expiry dates
- tests, methods, requirements, results, pass/fail
- reviewer approval and date

## Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
Typical required fields:
- product identification and revision date
- hazard classification and PPE requirements
- first aid, handling, storage guidance

## Calibration Record
Typical required fields:
- instrument/asset ID, calibration date, next due date
- tolerances and readings (as-found/as-left)
- technician approval and traceability statement

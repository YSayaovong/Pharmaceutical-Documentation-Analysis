# AI Opportunities in Pharmaceutical Documentation

Documentation operations are high-volume and high-risk. AI reduces manual effort while improving consistency and audit readiness.

## Practical use cases
### 1) Document classification
Automatically label incoming files as CoA, SDS, calibration, change control, and more.

### 2) Field extraction (OCR + NLP)
Extract key metadata:
- lot and batch identifiers
- dates and revision IDs
- specification references
- signatures and approval dates

### 3) Completeness checks
Detect missing required fields and formatting issues, then route to QA review.

### 4) Audit readiness search
Index documents so teams can retrieve evidence quickly during audits.

### 5) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Enable grounded Q&A over the document set for faster review and investigation.

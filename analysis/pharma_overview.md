# Pharmaceutical Documentation: Workflow Overview

Pharmaceutical organizations manage vendor documentation to ensure product quality, patient safety, and audit readiness. Vendor documents support material release decisions, supplier qualification, and equipment reliability.

## Why vendor documentation matters
Vendor documentation provides evidence that:
- the correct material was received and meets requirements
- measurement systems and equipment are calibrated and in control
- hazards are identified and controlled
- changes are reviewed and approved

## What strong documentation looks like
A strong process includes:
- consistent document types and required fields
- revision control and traceability
- reviewer approval records (who/when/why)
- fast retrieval during audits

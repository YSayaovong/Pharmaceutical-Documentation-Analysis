# Pharmaceutical Documentation Analysis

This project transforms a pharmaceutical documentation learning module into a clear, employer-ready artifact. It demonstrates how vendor documentation is reviewed, how compliance issues are identified, and where AI can reduce manual workload and error rates.

The project simulates a real documentation-review workflow used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality environments.

## 🧪 Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- PDF Parsing (conceptual – vendor documents included as examples)  
- Workflow + Compliance Visualization  
- AI Opportunity Mapping

## 📄 Included Vendor Documents

The project is designed to analyze:

- Certificate of Analysis (CoA)  
- Safety Data Sheet (SDS)  
- Calibration Record  

These files are typically part of regulated vendor compliance workflows.
